# Conway's Game of Life 
This repository contains Ruby implementation of "Conway's Game of Life". 

## What is Conway's Game of Life?
> The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

Rules
> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
> 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
> 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
> 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
